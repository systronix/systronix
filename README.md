- 👋 Hi, I’m  Bruce Boyes. This is a repository for Systronix Inc in Salt Lake City, UT. Main contributors are Bruce Boyes and Scott Kendall. Some repositories here are open source and public. Comments below relate to Bruce.
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded control systems, fire and explosion investigation, aviation, and numerous other things. We develop mainly using PJRC Teensy 3.2 and later controllers, and use Teensy 3.2 in a large scale commercial product. We program in C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Teensy 4.1 and the Raspberry Pi RP2040 Pico and Pico W, also ESP32 with cameras.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... whatever seems interesting and relevant at the time.
- In the distant past we have done a *lot* of 8051-family assembly code, including the special Dallas Semi supersets.
- Currently I am mostly working as a forensic engineer for MRA Forensic Sciences, and am a NAFI CFEI (Certified Fire and Explosion Investigator). I also hold credentials from IAAI (International Association of Arson Investigators). In addition to fires and explosions (commercial and residential structure, motor vehicle, marine, heavy equipment, small aircraft), I specialize in electrical or electronic product failure analysis. I have had success with difficult instrumentation and telemetry challenges.
